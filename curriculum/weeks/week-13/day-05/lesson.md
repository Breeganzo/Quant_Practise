## Theory Concepts

### Concept 1: Drift monitoring
Drift monitoring is a core part of 'Portfolio construction and optimization'. Start with notation discipline: define weights, constraints, and risk units before solving the allocation problem. Then focus on allocation constraints, risk decomposition, and capital efficiency by pairing at least one formula with one real market example (SPY/QQQ/AAPL or phase-relevant assets), verifying units, and documenting one failure mode that appears in stressed regimes.

### Concept 2: Rebalance frequency tradeoffs
Rebalance frequency tradeoffs is a core part of 'Portfolio construction and optimization'. Start with notation discipline: define weights, constraints, and risk units before solving the allocation problem. Then focus on allocation constraints, risk decomposition, and capital efficiency by pairing at least one formula with one real market example (SPY/QQQ/AAPL or phase-relevant assets), verifying units, and documenting one failure mode that appears in stressed regimes.

### Concept 3: Turnover and tax/cost awareness
Turnover and tax/cost awareness is a core part of 'Portfolio construction and optimization'. Start with notation discipline: define weights, constraints, and risk units before solving the allocation problem. Then focus on allocation constraints, risk decomposition, and capital efficiency by pairing at least one formula with one real market example (SPY/QQQ/AAPL or phase-relevant assets), verifying units, and documenting one failure mode that appears in stressed regimes.

## Mathematical Foundations (LaTeX)
### Formula 1: CVaR
$$
CVaR_\alpha=E[L\mid L\ge VaR_\alpha]
$$
**Plain-English interpretation:** Tail-risk expectation.
**Notation check:** Identify each symbol and its units before coding this formula.
**Real-world anchor:** Evaluate the metric on at least three assets and document which constraint changes the final portfolio most.

### Formula 2: Portfolio Return
$$
\mu_p=w^\top\mu
$$
**Plain-English interpretation:** Expected return from weighted assets.
**Notation check:** Identify each symbol and its units before coding this formula.
**Real-world anchor:** Evaluate the metric on at least three assets and document which constraint changes the final portfolio most.

### Formula 3: Portfolio Variance
$$
\sigma_p^2=w^\top\Sigma w
$$
**Plain-English interpretation:** Quadratic risk engine.
**Notation check:** Identify each symbol and its units before coding this formula.
**Real-world anchor:** Evaluate the metric on at least three assets and document which constraint changes the final portfolio most.

## Symbol Definitions

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $P_t$ | Price at time $t$ | USD/share | $110.50 |
| $r_t$ | Simple return | decimal or % | 0.012 = 1.2% |
| $\mu$ | Expected return | annualized decimal | 0.14 |
| $\sigma$ | Volatility (std. dev.) | annualized decimal | 0.18 |
| $w$ | Portfolio weights | sum to 1 | [0.35,0.25,0.40] |
| $\Sigma$ | Covariance matrix | return^2 | 3x3 matrix |
| $D_{mod}$ | Modified duration | years | 5.8 |

## Real Trading Example
- Instruments: SPY, TLT, GLD, HYG
- Macro overlay (FRED): DGS10, T10YIE
- Suggested window: 2018-01-01 to 2026-03-31
- Day objective: Simulate monthly vs quarterly rebalancing outcomes.

Execution narrative:
1. Pull market data from Yahoo Finance and align calendars.
2. Pull the listed FRED series and join strictly by release-aware timestamps.
3. Compute today's formulas and compare behavior in stress sub-periods.
4. Translate quantitative results into one explicit trading decision and one risk guardrail.
5. Validate that the decision is consistent with topic 'Portfolio monitoring and rebalance policy'.

## Step-by-Step Solved Problems
### Solved Problem 1: Portfolio expected return
Given:
- w=[0.6,0.4], mu=[0.12,0.08].
Solution:
1. $\mu_p=w^\top\mu$.
2. mu_p = 0.6*0.12 + 0.4*0.08 = 0.104.
Final answer: Portfolio expected return = 10.4%.
Common trap: Ignoring covariance and focusing only on expected return, which underestimates portfolio risk.
Interpretation: Write one sentence describing how this result would change a real trading decision.

### Solved Problem 2: Portfolio volatility
Given:
- sigma1=0.20, sigma2=0.12, rho=0.30, w1=0.6, w2=0.4.
Solution:
1. $\sigma_p^2=w_1^2\sigma_1^2+w_2^2\sigma_2^2+2w_1w_2\rho\sigma_1\sigma_2$.
2. sigma_p^2 = 0.02048.
3. sigma_p = sqrt(0.02048) = 0.1431.
Final answer: Portfolio volatility = 14.31%.
Common trap: Ignoring covariance and focusing only on expected return, which underestimates portfolio risk.
Interpretation: Write one sentence describing how this result would change a real trading decision.

### Solved Problem 3: Duration shock
Given:
- Modified duration = 5.8, yield shift = +0.25%.
Solution:
1. $\Delta P/P\approx-D_{mod}\Delta y$.
2. DeltaP/P = -5.8*0.0025 = -0.0145.
Final answer: Approximate bond price change = -1.45%.
Common trap: Ignoring covariance and focusing only on expected return, which underestimates portfolio risk.
Interpretation: Write one sentence describing how this result would change a real trading decision.

## Coding Walkthrough
1. Build an explicit data-ingestion layer with timestamp and schema checks.
2. Implement today's objective as reusable functions: Build rebalance trigger logic based on drift thresholds.
3. Add validation tests for leakage, NaNs, and unrealistic outliers.
4. Produce diagnostic plots and summarize one actionable trading rule.
5. Record one failure mode and one mitigation in comments.

Reference implementation sketch:
```python
mu, cov = estimate_moments(asset_returns)
weights = solve_constrained_mv(mu, cov, max_weight=0.35)
risk_budget = risk_contributions(weights, cov)
rebalance_flag = should_rebalance(weights, target_weights, threshold=0.03)
```

## Block 5: Practice, Quiz, and Interview Drill

### Practice Problems
1. Re-derive today's formulas manually and define every variable and unit.
2. Re-run the real trading example with one alternate ticker and compare outputs.
3. Stress-test one assumption and write one explicit risk-control rule.
4. Extend the coding walkthrough with one validation test and one edge-case test.
5. Record one interview-ready explanation in less than 60 seconds.

### Daily Quiz (Realistic Interview Style)
1. In Week 13 Day 05, explain one formula from today's lesson in plain language and define every symbol used.
2. Using one real asset from today's universe, compute the metric and state one risk guardrail you would enforce.
3. Interview drill: In 60 seconds, explain why 'Portfolio monitoring and rebalance policy' matters for production trading systems.

Answer key template:
- Q1: Formula + symbol table + units.
- Q2: Numeric result + interpretation + guardrail.
- Q3: One concise story linking model, risk, and execution.

### Interview Drill
- Prompt: "Walk me through Portfolio monitoring and rebalance policy as if you are presenting to a PM who cares about risk-adjusted returns."
- What interviewers look for:
  1. Correct notation and units.
  2. Ability to connect theory to a real trade decision.
  3. Awareness of edge cases, costs, and failure modes.
