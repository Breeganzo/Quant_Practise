## Theory Concepts

### Concept 1: Dimensionality reduction
Dimensionality reduction is a core part of 'Unsupervised learning and market regimes'. Start with notation discipline: define labels, feature windows, and leakage boundaries before fitting any model. Then focus on causal feature design, leakage control, and robust model validation by pairing at least one formula with one real market example (SPY/QQQ/AAPL or phase-relevant assets), verifying units, and documenting one failure mode that appears in stressed regimes.

### Concept 2: Variance concentration
Variance concentration is a core part of 'Unsupervised learning and market regimes'. Start with notation discipline: define labels, feature windows, and leakage boundaries before fitting any model. Then focus on causal feature design, leakage control, and robust model validation by pairing at least one formula with one real market example (SPY/QQQ/AAPL or phase-relevant assets), verifying units, and documenting one failure mode that appears in stressed regimes.

### Concept 3: Noise filtering tradeoffs
Noise filtering tradeoffs is a core part of 'Unsupervised learning and market regimes'. Start with notation discipline: define labels, feature windows, and leakage boundaries before fitting any model. Then focus on causal feature design, leakage control, and robust model validation by pairing at least one formula with one real market example (SPY/QQQ/AAPL or phase-relevant assets), verifying units, and documenting one failure mode that appears in stressed regimes.

## Mathematical Foundations (LaTeX)
### Formula 1: MSE
$$
\mathcal{L}_{MSE}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_i(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2
$$
**Plain-English interpretation:** Baseline regression loss.
**Notation check:** Identify each symbol and its units before coding this formula.
**Real-world anchor:** Use a walk-forward split and verify the metric does not leak future labels into feature construction.

### Formula 2: Cross-Entropy
$$
\mathcal{L}_{CE}=-\frac{1}{n}\sum_i[y_i\log p_i+(1-y_i)\log(1-p_i)]
$$
**Plain-English interpretation:** Classification objective.
**Notation check:** Identify each symbol and its units before coding this formula.
**Real-world anchor:** Use a walk-forward split and verify the metric does not leak future labels into feature construction.

### Formula 3: Ridge Penalty
$$
\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{MSE}+\lambda\|\beta\|_2^2
$$
**Plain-English interpretation:** Regularized stability control.
**Notation check:** Identify each symbol and its units before coding this formula.
**Real-world anchor:** Use a walk-forward split and verify the metric does not leak future labels into feature construction.

## Symbol Definitions
| Symbol | Meaning | Units | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $P_t$ | Price at time $t$ | USD/share | $110.50 |
| $r_t$ | Simple return | decimal or % | 0.012 = 1.2% |
| $\mu$ | Expected return | annualized decimal | 0.14 |
| $\sigma$ | Volatility (std. dev.) | annualized decimal | 0.18 |
| $\hat{y}$ | Model prediction | class/probability | 0.73 |
| $\lambda$ | Regularization strength | non-negative scalar | 0.10 |
| $TP,FP,FN$ | Confusion matrix counts | integer count | TP=52 |

## Real Trading Example
- Instruments: SPY, XLK, XLF, XLE
- Macro overlay (FRED): DFF, VIXCLS
- Suggested window: 2018-01-01 to 2026-03-31
- Day objective: Use PCA components as regime features and visualize transitions.

Execution narrative:
1. Pull market data from Yahoo Finance and align calendars.
2. Pull the listed FRED series and join strictly by release-aware timestamps.
3. Compute today's formulas and compare behavior in stress sub-periods.
4. Translate quantitative results into one explicit trading decision and one risk guardrail.
5. Validate that the decision is consistent with topic 'PCA for regime and factor hints'.

## Step-by-Step Solved Problems
### Solved Problem 1: Convert logit to probability
Given:
- Model score z = 0.200.
Solution:
1. $p=\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$.
2. p = 1/(1+exp(-0.200)) = 0.549834.
Final answer: Predicted probability = 54.98%.
Common trap: Using forward labels with backward-filled features, which silently introduces leakage.
Interpretation: Write one sentence describing how this result would change a real trading decision.

### Solved Problem 2: Compute precision, recall, F1
Given:
- TP=50, FP=12, FN=18.
Solution:
1. $Precision=\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$.
2. Precision=0.8065.
3. $Recall=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$.
4. Recall=0.7353.
5. $F1=\frac{2PR}{P+R}$.
6. F1=0.7692.
Final answer: Precision=80.65%, Recall=73.53%, F1=76.92%.
Common trap: Using forward labels with backward-filled features, which silently introduces leakage.
Interpretation: Write one sentence describing how this result would change a real trading decision.

### Solved Problem 3: Compute ridge objective
Given:
- MSE = 0.0410, ||beta||_2^2 = 1.90, lambda = 0.06.
Solution:
1. $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{MSE}+\lambda\|\beta\|_2^2$.
2. L = 0.0410 + 0.06*1.90 = 0.1550.
Final answer: Ridge objective = 0.1550.
Common trap: Using forward labels with backward-filled features, which silently introduces leakage.
Interpretation: Write one sentence describing how this result would change a real trading decision.

## Coding Walkthrough
1. Build an explicit data-ingestion layer with timestamp and schema checks.
2. Implement today's objective as reusable functions: Project features into principal-component space and label clusters.
3. Add validation tests for leakage, NaNs, and unrealistic outliers.
4. Produce diagnostic plots and summarize one actionable trading rule.
5. Record one failure mode and one mitigation in comments.

Reference implementation sketch:
```python
X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = temporal_split(features, target)
model = fit_logistic_regression(X_train, y_train, l2=0.1)
proba = model.predict_proba(X_valid)[:, 1]
report = classification_report_from_thresholds(y_valid, proba)
```

## Block 5: Practice, Quiz, and Interview Drill

### Practice Problems
1. Re-derive today's formulas manually and define every variable and unit.
2. Re-run the real trading example with one alternate ticker and compare outputs.
3. Stress-test one assumption and write one explicit risk-control rule.
4. Extend the coding walkthrough with one validation test and one edge-case test.
5. Record one interview-ready explanation in less than 60 seconds.

### Daily Quiz (Realistic Interview Style)
1. In Week 07 Day 03, explain one formula from today's lesson in plain language and define every symbol used.
2. Using one real asset from today's universe, compute the metric and state one risk guardrail you would enforce.
3. Interview drill: In 60 seconds, explain why 'PCA for regime and factor hints' matters for production trading systems.

Answer key template:
- Q1: Formula + symbol table + units.
- Q2: Numeric result + interpretation + guardrail.
- Q3: One concise story linking model, risk, and execution.

### Interview Drill
- Prompt: "Walk me through PCA for regime and factor hints as if you are presenting to a PM who cares about risk-adjusted returns."
- What interviewers look for:
  1. Correct notation and units.
  2. Ability to connect theory to a real trade decision.
  3. Awareness of edge cases, costs, and failure modes.
