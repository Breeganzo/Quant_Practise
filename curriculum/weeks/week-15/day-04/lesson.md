## Theory Concepts

### Concept 1: Delta hedging intuition
Delta hedging intuition is a core part of 'Derivatives and options basics'. Start with notation discipline: define weights, constraints, and risk units before solving the allocation problem. Then focus on allocation constraints, risk decomposition, and capital efficiency by pairing at least one formula with one real market example (SPY/QQQ/AAPL or phase-relevant assets), verifying units, and documenting one failure mode that appears in stressed regimes.

### Concept 2: Rehedging frequency tradeoff
Rehedging frequency tradeoff is a core part of 'Derivatives and options basics'. Start with notation discipline: define weights, constraints, and risk units before solving the allocation problem. Then focus on allocation constraints, risk decomposition, and capital efficiency by pairing at least one formula with one real market example (SPY/QQQ/AAPL or phase-relevant assets), verifying units, and documenting one failure mode that appears in stressed regimes.

### Concept 3: Hedging costs and slippage
Hedging costs and slippage is a core part of 'Derivatives and options basics'. Start with notation discipline: define weights, constraints, and risk units before solving the allocation problem. Then focus on allocation constraints, risk decomposition, and capital efficiency by pairing at least one formula with one real market example (SPY/QQQ/AAPL or phase-relevant assets), verifying units, and documenting one failure mode that appears in stressed regimes.

## Mathematical Foundations (LaTeX)
### Formula 1: Duration Shock
$$
\frac{\Delta P}{P}\approx-D_{mod}\Delta y
$$
**Plain-English interpretation:** First-order bond sensitivity.
**Notation check:** Identify each symbol and its units before coding this formula.
**Real-world anchor:** Evaluate the metric on at least three assets and document which constraint changes the final portfolio most.

### Formula 2: CVaR
$$
CVaR_\alpha=E[L\mid L\ge VaR_\alpha]
$$
**Plain-English interpretation:** Tail-risk expectation.
**Notation check:** Identify each symbol and its units before coding this formula.
**Real-world anchor:** Measure allocation drift before and after rebalancing to confirm risk controls are effective.

### Formula 3: Portfolio Return
$$
\mu_p=w^\top\mu
$$
**Plain-English interpretation:** Expected return from weighted assets.
**Notation check:** Identify each symbol and its units before coding this formula.
**Real-world anchor:** Record one scenario where diversification fails and describe the contingency hedge.

## Symbol Definitions

| $D_{mod}$ | Modified duration | years | 5.8 |

## Real Trading Example
- Instruments: SPY, TLT, GLD, HYG
- Macro overlay (FRED): DGS10, T10YIE
- Suggested window: 2018-01-01 to 2026-03-31
- Stress windows to inspect: 2020-02 to 2020-04, 2022-01 to 2022-10
- Scenario context: cross-asset drawdown with correlation spikes
- Day objective: Simulate a simple delta-hedging loop on synthetic price paths.

Execution narrative:
1. Pull market data from Yahoo Finance and align calendars.
2. Pull listed FRED series and join strictly by release-aware timestamps (no look-ahead).
3. Compute today's formulas and compare calm vs stress-window behavior.
4. Translate outputs into one explicit trade action and one hard risk guardrail.
5. Validate that the decision is consistent with topic 'Hedging workflow basics'.

## Step-by-Step Solved Problems
### Solved Problem 1: Portfolio expected return
Given:
- w=[0.6,0.4], mu=[0.12,0.08].
Solution:
1. $\mu_p=w^\top\mu$.
2. mu_p = 0.6*0.12 + 0.4*0.08 = 0.104.
Final answer: Portfolio expected return = 10.4%.
Common trap: Ignoring covariance and focusing only on expected return, which underestimates portfolio risk.
Interpretation: Write one sentence describing how this result would change a real trading decision.

### Solved Problem 2: Portfolio volatility
Given:
- sigma1=0.20, sigma2=0.12, rho=0.30, w1=0.6, w2=0.4.
Solution:
1. $\sigma_p^2=w_1^2\sigma_1^2+w_2^2\sigma_2^2+2w_1w_2\rho\sigma_1\sigma_2$.
2. sigma_p^2 = 0.02048.
3. sigma_p = sqrt(0.02048) = 0.1431.
Final answer: Portfolio volatility = 14.31%.
Common trap: Ignoring covariance and focusing only on expected return, which underestimates portfolio risk.
Interpretation: Write one sentence describing how this result would change a real trading decision.

### Solved Problem 3: Duration shock
Given:
- Modified duration = 5.8, yield shift = +0.25%.
Solution:
1. $\Delta P/P\approx-D_{mod}\Delta y$.
2. DeltaP/P = -5.8*0.0025 = -0.0145.
Final answer: Approximate bond price change = -1.45%.
Common trap: Ignoring covariance and focusing only on expected return, which underestimates portfolio risk.
Interpretation: Write one sentence describing how this result would change a real trading decision.

## Coding Walkthrough
1. Build an explicit data-ingestion layer with timestamp and schema checks.
2. Implement today's objective as reusable functions: Implement discrete hedging simulation and PnL decomposition.
3. Add validation tests for leakage, NaNs, and unrealistic outliers.
4. Produce diagnostic plots and summarize one actionable trading rule.
5. Record one failure mode and one mitigation in comments.

Reference implementation sketch:
```python
mu, cov = estimate_moments(asset_returns)
weights = solve_constrained_mv(mu, cov, max_weight=0.35)
risk_budget = risk_contributions(weights, cov)
rebalance_flag = should_rebalance(weights, target_weights, threshold=0.03)
```

## Block 5: Practice, Quiz, and Interview Drill

### Practice Problems
1. Re-derive today's formulas manually and define every variable and unit.
2. Re-run the real trading example with one alternate ticker and compare outputs.
3. Stress-test one assumption and write one explicit risk-control rule.
4. Extend the coding walkthrough with one validation test and one edge-case test.
5. Record one interview-ready explanation in less than 60 seconds.

### Daily Quiz (Realistic Interview Style)
1. PM interview question (Week 15 Day 04): Explain Duration Shock and define every symbol clearly for a cross-asset drawdown week with correlation spikes.
   - Model answer: "I use Duration Shock as a decision bridge from market observations to position sizing. The formula is $\frac{\Delta P}{P}\approx-D_{mod}\Delta y$. I define each symbol with units first, then compute one concrete value, and finally state what trade action changes because of the result in this regime."
2. Risk manager question: Using one real ticker from this lesson, what hard guardrail would you enforce before live deployment?
   - Model answer: "I would run the workflow on SPY and a stress-sensitive peer, then force rebalance when risk-budget contribution of one sleeve exceeds 40%. If the guardrail triggers, I switch to paper-trade monitoring and block new risk until diagnostics re-pass."
3. Data integrity question: Which checks must pass before you trust the output and place risk?
   - Model answer: "Before trading I verify covariance window consistency, stale-price filtering, and exposure normalization checks. If any check fails, I classify the run as non-tradable and log the incident."
4. Production question: Why does 'Hedging workflow basics' matter in live trading systems?
   - Model answer: "Hedging workflow basics matters because portfolio choices are constrained by covariance instability, transaction costs, and risk budgets. In production I need reproducible calculations, explicit control limits, and escalation rules that survive stress windows."
5. Decision question: If your key metric degrades for three consecutive sessions, what is your fallback plan?
   - Model answer: "I de-risk to benchmark weights, rerun stress tests, and re-enable risk only after guardrails pass. I only restore risk after rerun evidence confirms that assumptions are stable again."

Scoring rubric:
- 10/10: correct notation, one numeric example, explicit guardrail, data checks, and escalation path.
- 8/10: mostly correct notation plus a clear guardrail and fallback action.
- 6/10: partial correctness but vague controls or missing data validation.
- Below 6/10: formula recall without decision-quality risk controls.

### Interview Drill
- Prompt: "Walk me through Hedging workflow basics in an investment committee session after correlation breakdown."
- What interviewers look for:
  1. Correct notation and units.
  2. Ability to connect theory to a real trade decision under constraints.
  3. Awareness of edge cases, costs, and failure modes.
  4. Clear escalation rule when guardrails are breached.
- Model answer framework:
  - Context: define business objective and market regime.
  - Method: state formula, assumptions, and validation checks clearly.
  - Decision: explain one actionable rule, one risk guardrail, and one fallback action.
