## Theory Concepts

### Concept 1: Skewness and kurtosis in return data
Skewness and kurtosis in return data is a core part of 'Return/risk analytics and exploratory capstone'. Start with notation discipline: define prices, returns, percentages, and all symbols before doing any arithmetic. Then focus on clean data assumptions and stable mathematical transformations by pairing at least one formula with one real market example (SPY/QQQ/AAPL or phase-relevant assets), verifying units, and documenting one failure mode that appears in stressed regimes.

### Concept 2: Tail event frequency
Tail event frequency is a core part of 'Return/risk analytics and exploratory capstone'. Start with notation discipline: define prices, returns, percentages, and all symbols before doing any arithmetic. Then focus on clean data assumptions and stable mathematical transformations by pairing at least one formula with one real market example (SPY/QQQ/AAPL or phase-relevant assets), verifying units, and documenting one failure mode that appears in stressed regimes.

### Concept 3: Downside-focused metrics
Downside-focused metrics is a core part of 'Return/risk analytics and exploratory capstone'. Start with notation discipline: define prices, returns, percentages, and all symbols before doing any arithmetic. Then focus on clean data assumptions and stable mathematical transformations by pairing at least one formula with one real market example (SPY/QQQ/AAPL or phase-relevant assets), verifying units, and documenting one failure mode that appears in stressed regimes.

## Mathematical Foundations (LaTeX)
### Formula 1: Log Return
$$
\ell_t = \ln\left(\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\right)
$$
**Plain-English interpretation:** Additive return representation.
**Notation check:** Identify each symbol and its units before coding this formula.
**Real-world anchor:** Compute this on SPY and QQQ daily closes, then compare how one volatile day changes the metric.

### Formula 2: Annualized Volatility
$$
\sigma_{ann}=\sqrt{252}\,Std(r_t)
$$
**Plain-English interpretation:** Scale daily uncertainty to annual horizon.
**Notation check:** Identify each symbol and its units before coding this formula.
**Real-world anchor:** Compute this on SPY and QQQ daily closes, then compare how one volatile day changes the metric.

### Formula 3: Sharpe Ratio
$$
S=\frac{R_{ann}-R_f}{\sigma_{ann}}
$$
**Plain-English interpretation:** Risk-adjusted performance score.
**Notation check:** Identify each symbol and its units before coding this formula.
**Real-world anchor:** Compute this on SPY and QQQ daily closes, then compare how one volatile day changes the metric.

## Symbol Definitions
| Symbol | Meaning | Units | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $P_t$ | Price at time $t$ | USD/share | $110.50 |
| $r_t$ | Simple return | decimal or % | 0.012 = 1.2% |
| $\mu$ | Expected return | annualized decimal | 0.14 |
| $\sigma$ | Volatility (std. dev.) | annualized decimal | 0.18 |
| $R_f$ | Risk-free rate | annualized decimal | 0.03 |
| $TO_t$ | Portfolio turnover | fraction of portfolio | 0.12 |

## Real Trading Example
- Instruments: SPY, QQQ, AAPL
- Macro overlay (FRED): DGS10, UNRATE
- Suggested window: 2018-01-01 to 2026-03-31
- Day objective: Evaluate return histograms and downside risk frequencies for multiple assets.

Execution narrative:
1. Pull market data from Yahoo Finance and align calendars.
2. Pull the listed FRED series and join strictly by release-aware timestamps.
3. Compute today's formulas and compare behavior in stress sub-periods.
4. Translate quantitative results into one explicit trading decision and one risk guardrail.
5. Validate that the decision is consistent with topic 'Risk distribution diagnostics'.

## Step-by-Step Solved Problems
### Solved Problem 1: Compute simple return
Given:
- Price moves from $104.00 to $105.35.
Solution:
1. $r_t=\frac{P_t-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$.
2. r_t = (105.352-104.000)/104.000 = 0.013000.
Final answer: Simple return = 1.30%.
Common trap: Confusing percentage return with absolute dollar change or forgetting that returns compound multiplicatively.
Interpretation: Write one sentence describing how this result would change a real trading decision.

### Solved Problem 2: Annualize volatility
Given:
- Daily volatility estimate is 0.0119.
Solution:
1. $\sigma_{ann}=\sqrt{252}\cdot\sigma_d$.
2. sigma_ann = sqrt(252)*0.0119 = 0.1889.
Final answer: Annualized volatility = 18.89%.
Common trap: Confusing percentage return with absolute dollar change or forgetting that returns compound multiplicatively.
Interpretation: Write one sentence describing how this result would change a real trading decision.

### Solved Problem 3: Compute Sharpe ratio
Given:
- Annual return is 14.0%, risk-free rate is 3.0%.
- Use volatility 18.89%.
Solution:
1. $S=\frac{R_{ann}-R_f}{\sigma_{ann}}$.
2. S = (0.14-0.03)/0.1889 = 0.5823.
Final answer: Sharpe ratio = 0.58.
Common trap: Confusing percentage return with absolute dollar change or forgetting that returns compound multiplicatively.
Interpretation: Write one sentence describing how this result would change a real trading decision.

## Coding Walkthrough
1. Build an explicit data-ingestion layer with timestamp and schema checks.
2. Implement today's objective as reusable functions: Build a downside-risk summary table including semi-variance.
3. Add validation tests for leakage, NaNs, and unrealistic outliers.
4. Produce diagnostic plots and summarize one actionable trading rule.
5. Record one failure mode and one mitigation in comments.

Reference implementation sketch:
```python
prices = load_prices(['SPY', 'QQQ', 'AAPL'])
returns = prices.pct_change().dropna()
metrics = compute_risk_metrics(returns)
assert metrics['max_drawdown'] <= 0
```

## Block 5: Practice, Quiz, and Interview Drill

### Practice Problems
1. Re-derive today's formulas manually and define every variable and unit.
2. Re-run the real trading example with one alternate ticker and compare outputs.
3. Stress-test one assumption and write one explicit risk-control rule.
4. Extend the coding walkthrough with one validation test and one edge-case test.
5. Record one interview-ready explanation in less than 60 seconds.

### Daily Quiz (Realistic Interview Style)
1. In Week 04 Day 02, explain one formula from today's lesson in plain language and define every symbol used.
2. Using one real asset from today's universe, compute the metric and state one risk guardrail you would enforce.
3. Interview drill: In 60 seconds, explain why 'Risk distribution diagnostics' matters for production trading systems.

Answer key template:
- Q1: Formula + symbol table + units.
- Q2: Numeric result + interpretation + guardrail.
- Q3: One concise story linking model, risk, and execution.

### Interview Drill
- Prompt: "Walk me through Risk distribution diagnostics as if you are presenting to a PM who cares about risk-adjusted returns."
- What interviewers look for:
  1. Correct notation and units.
  2. Ability to connect theory to a real trade decision.
  3. Awareness of edge cases, costs, and failure modes.
